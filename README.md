# **Module 1**

**Task 1: Loading Hospitalization Details**

In this task, we load the hospitalization details from the 'hospitalisation_details.csv' file into a Pandas DataFrame named 'hosp_details.' This step is essential for our new project, "Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insights," as it forms the foundation for the data analysis and insights that we aim to derive from the medical dataset.

**Task 2: Identifying Null Values in Hospitalization Details**

In this task, we identify and count the null values in the 'hosp_details' dataset. This step is crucial for our new project, "Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insights," as it helps us understand the extent of missing data within the dataset. Recognizing and handling null values is essential for ensuring the accuracy and quality of our data analysis and insights.

**->** "I identified a null value in the 'mth' column." I can use the **'dropna()'** function to remove that specific row containing the null value.

**Task 3: Identifying Data Types in Hospitalization Details**

In this task, we determine the data types of the columns in the 'hosp_details' dataset. This step is vital for our data analysis, as it provides insights into how the data is stored and helps us select appropriate methods for further analysis. Understanding the data types is crucial for working with the dataset effectively.

**Task 4: Identifying Duplicate Data in Hospitalization Details**

In this task, we aim to identify and quantify the presence of duplicate data within the 'hosp_details' dataset. The count of duplicates (referred to as 'duplicates' in the code) is an important metric. It helps us understand the extent of redundancy in the dataset, which is crucial for data quality and accuracy in our analysis. By recognizing and handling duplicate records, we ensure that our insights and conclusions are based on unique, meaningful data, preventing any potential distortions caused by repeated entries.

**->** "I have detected 89 duplicate entries in the dataset, and I am utilizing the **'drop_duplicates()'** function to eliminate these duplicate records from the dataset."

**Task 5: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning for Hospitalization Details**

In this task, we perform data preprocessing and cleaning on the 'hosp_details' dataset. We start by removing duplicate records to ensure data quality and accuracy. Next, we remove specific columns, 'Has_Children' and 'Is_Frequent_Treatment,' as they are not relevant to our analysis. We also rename columns to improve clarity and understanding of the data. Finally, we save the cleaned dataset as 'hospitalisation_details_cleaned.csv.' This data preprocessing and cleaning is crucial for our analysis, as it ensures that we work with accurate and meaningful data in our new project.

**Task 6: Loading Medical Examination Data**

In this task, we load the medical examination data from the 'medical_examinations.csv' file into a Pandas DataFrame named 'med_exam.' This step is essential for our new project, "Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insights," as it forms the foundation for the data analysis and insights that we aim to derive from the medical dataset.


**Task 7: Identifying Null Values in Medical Examination Data**

In this task, we identify and count the null values in the 'med_exam' dataset. This step is crucial for our new project, as it helps us understand the extent of missing data within the dataset. Recognizing and handling null values is essential for ensuring the accuracy and quality of our data analysis and insights.

**->** "I identified a null value in the **'recovery_period'** column." I can use the **'drop()'** function to remove that specific column containing the null value.
In these tasks, I have also substituted the value 'No major surgery' with 0 in the column 'noofmajorsurgeries' to enhance the analytical process.

**Task 8: Identifying Data Types in Medical Examination Data**

In this task, we determine the data types of the columns in the 'med_exam' dataset. This step is vital for our data analysis, as it provides insights into how the data is stored and helps us select appropriate methods for further analysis. Understanding the data types is crucial for working with the dataset effectively.

**Task 9: Identifying Duplicate Data in Medical Examination Data**

In this task, we aim to identify and quantify the presence of duplicate data within the 'med_exam' dataset. The count of duplicates (referred to as 'duplicates' in the code) is an important metric. It helps us understand the extent of redundancy in the dataset, which is crucial for data quality and accuracy in our analysis. By recognizing and handling duplicate records, we ensure that our insights and conclusions are based on unique, meaningful data, preventing any potential distortions caused by repeated entries.

**->** "I have detected 39 duplicate entries in the dataset, and I am utilizing the **'drop_duplicates()'** function to eliminate these duplicate records from the dataset."

**Task 10: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning for Medical Examination Data******

In this task, we perform data preprocessing and cleaning on the 'med_exam' dataset. We start by removing duplicate records to ensure data quality and accuracy. Next, we remove a specific column, 'recovery_period,' as it may not be relevant to our analysis. We also rename columns to improve clarity and understanding of the data. Finally, we save the cleaned dataset as 'medical_examinations_cleaned.csv.' This data preprocessing and cleaning is crucial for our analysis, as it ensures that we work with accurate and meaningful data in our new project.

This information is valuable for targeted healthcare interventions and assessing associated healthcare costs.n.

**Task 13: Customers with Highest Charges and City Tier by Year**

In this project, we identify the customer with the highest total charges for each year and display their corresponding city_tier. By joining the hospitalization_details and names tables and grouping the data by year, customer name, and city_tier, we can determine which customer incurred the highest charges in each year. This analysis is crucial for understanding cost patterns over time and tailoring healthcare strategies accordingly.n.

**Task 14: Top 3 Customers with Highest Average Yearly Charges**

This project focuses on identifying the top 3 customers with the highest average yearly charges over the years they have been hospitalized. By calculating and analyzing the average yearly charges from the hospitalization_details data and joining it with customer names, we can pinpoint those individuals with the highest healthcare expenditure. Understanding these patterns is essential for resource allocation and tailored healthcare planning.n.

**Task 15: Ranking Customers by Total Charges**

This analysis aims to rank customers based on their total charges over the years in descending order. By summing up the charges from the hospitalization_details data for each customer and assigning a rank, we can identify those with the highest healthcare expenses. This information is valuable for healthcare providers and policymakers in tailoring services and managing resources effectively.n.

**Task 16: Identifying Peak Year for Hospitalizations**

This task is essential for identifying the year with the highest number of hospitalizations. By calculating the count of hospitalizations for each year from the hospitalization_details dataset, we can pinpoint the peak year for healthcare demand. This insight can help healthcare institutions allocate resources and plan for peak demand years more effectively.
